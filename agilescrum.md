# In Practice

###But what do these concepts mean in practice?
0)Everything will start with the Business/Customer providing its requirements and needs to the Product Owner;

0)The Product Owner will define, together with the Team and the Scrum Master, the Product Backlog(DEEP- Detailed appropriately, Estimated, Emergent, Prioritized) according to the User Stories which will be created based on the Customerâ€™s requirements and needs;(arranging the story in right order is the PRIORITIZATION.

0)Later, the Team will define the plan to deliver the features that were selected in the Product Backlog. This activity will be delivered during the next Sprint, and coached by the Scrum Master. Two major questions must be answered during Sprint Planning:

0)What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?

0)How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

0)The Sprint Backlog will contain the tasks that will be performed by the Team to achieve the Sprint goal. The Sprint cannot be longer than four weeks;(life of a Sprint backlog lasts for one Sprint)

0)The Increment represents the set of all Product Backlog items completed so far in the project (up to the end of a certain Sprint)

0)The Team will begin work on the objectives as soon as Sprint Planning is completed. During the Sprint, the Team will hold a daily meeting (15 minutes) to coordinate the work for the next 24 hours. This meeting is called the Daily Scrum.

0)Before the end of the Sprint, the Team presents or demonstrates the outcome of the Sprint to the customer and receives feedback. This meeting is called Sprint Review, also known as Sprint Demo.

0)After the Sprint Review and just before the Sprint is over, the Team holds an internal meeting to review the Sprint and use it to improve the process in the next Sprint. This meeting is called Sprint Retrospective.
